# to-do
This project is a lightweight to-do list application built with HTML, TailwindCSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Itâ€™s integrated with PostHog to capture key user interactions (task_added, task_completed, task_deleted) and display analytics on a custom dashboard. Ideal as a learning project for understanding how product analytics can be applied to real user flows.
